## Warning
The code won't work because it is missing google-services.json, but sharing it is considered a security risk. When developing this project, this is required:

Clone this repository
Set up Firebase configuration:

Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
Add your Android app to the project
Download google-services.json
Place it in the app/ folder
Enable Authentication and Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console
